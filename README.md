# etch-a-sketch
Current Roadmap to project finalization - as note to myself:
1) Complete the page navigation for when there are more than 6 options available - DONE!
2) Work on "rate" endgame logic -> biggest task at the moment
3) Add text for flirt/perform routes
4) Add death screen for the end of the insult route
5) Add flavor/Mett text for disabling animations
6) Work on "fight" action to allow changing the size of the canvas
7) Convert all animations to use RequestAnimationFrame() method for better efficiency, as the amount of setIntervals is a bit heavy on game's functionality
8) Add title to the load screen
9) Work on scaling for lower screen resolutions

Project notes:

Initially, I've planned to add keyboard navigation as an option as well to better imitate Undertale's style of gameplay, but decided that logic required to implement that is a bit beyond me for the moment. This project got a out of scope of the initial task requirements - and while things I've learned during its completion were really informative, I wanted to complete it for now to be able to proceed with the course.

But in the future I plan to revisit this project and add that functionality.
