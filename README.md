Acknowledgements/Thank-Yous:

I'm greatly thankful to my girlfriend for giving me feedback/valuable hints on how the visuals/functionality of this project could be improved. 

@https://undertale-resources.tumblr.com - this Tumblr blog was a wonderful resource for the necessary Undertale-related trivia - I wouldn't be able to locate some of the needed sounds effects without them. 

Determination/MonsterFriend2 fonts in this project come from @UkiyoMoji Fonts - https://www.behance.net/JapanYoshi
Mercy font comes from MaxiGamer - https://twitter.com/MaxiGamerART
Pixelated font comes from Auntie Pixelante (? I couldn't locate author's current nickname/active profiles anywhere)
DotumChe Pixel is made by William Costello - https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/1389119/fab-william1729


all music/sound effects used within this project are made by Toby Fox and come from his game "Undertale" - if you haven't played it before, I highly recommend checking it out - https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/
