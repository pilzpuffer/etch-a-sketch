Project notes:

Initially, I've planned to add keyboard navigation as an option as well to better imitate Undertale's style of gameplay, but decided that logic required to implement that is a bit beyond me for the moment. Plus all this project already seems to be wayy beyond what the initial task required of it - thus, I wanted to complete it for now to be able to proceed with the course.

But in the future I plan to revisit this project and add that functionality.
